This project serves as a demo of the Learning Translations via Images research project. 
IT IS MEANT ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE NLP LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.

Demo is initiated by opening index.html file.

If you wish to replace the images, you should use the ImageVectorPacker program to extract images from the nlpgrid, 
then copy the files compiled by the script (inside the demofiles folder) directly into the images folder (get rid of the previous images).
You should not copy the demofiles folder itself, only its contents.
